        <h2 class="description">Description</h2>
        <p>Kurma is a popular Trinidadian snack made of spiced dough that is fried until crispy and coated in a sweet, crackly sugar syrup. It’s crunchy, lightly spiced with cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg, and is often enjoyed during festive occasions like Divali or simply as a sweet treat.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sugar (for the dough)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter (softened)</li>
            <li>¾ cup water (approximately, for mixing dough)</li>
            <li>Oil for deep frying</li>
            <li>1 cup sugar (for the syrup)</li>
            <li>½ cup water (for the syrup)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla essence (for syrup flavoring)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the flour, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, salt, and 2 tablespoons of sugar.</li>
            <li><strong>Add butter:</strong> Rub the softened butter into the flour mixture until it looks like fine breadcrumbs.</li>
            <li><strong>Form the dough:</strong> Slowly add the water a little at a time, kneading gently until you form a soft but firm dough (not sticky).</li>
            <li><strong>Rest the dough:</strong> Let the dough rest for about 10–15 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Roll and cut:</strong> Roll out the dough on a floured surface until it’s about ¼ inch thick. Cut into thin strips (about finger size).</li>
            <li><strong>Fry the dough:</strong> Heat oil in a deep pan. Fry the strips over medium heat until golden brown and crispy. Remove and drain on paper towels.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the syrup:</strong> In a pot, combine 1 cup sugar and ½ cup water. Bring to a boil and cook until it reaches a slightly thick, sticky consistency (like light thread stage). Stir in the vanilla essence.</li>
            <li><strong>Coat the kurma:</strong> Quickly toss the fried kurma into the hot syrup, mixing well to coat each piece evenly.</li>
            <li><strong>Cool and harden:</strong> Spread the syrup-coated kurma on a tray to cool and harden.</li>
        </ol>
