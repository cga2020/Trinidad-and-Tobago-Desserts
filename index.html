        <h2>Welcome to Trini Delights</h2>
        <p>Trinidadian desserts, often called Trini desserts, are a delightful fusion of flavors influenced by the island’s diverse cultural heritage, including African, Indian, European, and Creole traditions. These sweet treats often feature ingredients like coconut, condensed milk, spices, and tropical fruits. Popular desserts include <strong><em>cassava pone</em></strong>, a moist and chewy baked treat made with grated cassava and coconut; <strong><em>kurma</em></strong>, a fried spiced dough coated in sugar syrup; and <strong><em>sweet bread</em></strong>, a rich coconut-filled loaf. Trini desserts are not only a staple at celebrations and holidays but also a flavorful expression of the island’s rich culinary identity.</p>
